            Still a great article but a few things need fixing:

            1) Bullet points, “There are many models to choose from” and “Several  models to choose from” are repetitive.

            2) This sentence was already mentioned in another paragraph: “some of them can even work as low as -35 degree celsius” (repetitive).
